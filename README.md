Git repository containing a mern stack project "dashboard of an inventory system".


project is divided into 2 folders frontend and backend.

to start backend server goto backend and run command "npm run dev".similarly to start frontend server, goto frontend and run "npm run dev" .

i have implemented the login,signup and logout mechanism with bcrypt and JWT.<br>
i have also added options to create and delete and fetch products from database.<br>
i almost implemented the update function but it is not fully functional due to a logical error.

i couldnt implement the favourite items list feature in given time even though i know the logic and strongly believe i can implement it with a given time.
